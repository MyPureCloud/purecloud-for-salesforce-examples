# PureCloud for Salesforce Examples
This repository contains various example applications for PureCloud for Salesforce.

:warning: **Warning for the Lightning Experience example**:
The Lightning component code contained in this repository depends on Lightning Message Service (LMS), which is currently a beta feature in Salesforce. The Lightning component code will not work in the Lightning Experience example until the following occurs:
 
* Salesforce announces the general availability of LMS.
* Genesys updates and releases the PureCloud for Salesforce managed package with LMS support.
 
Until then, use the [post message example branch]( https://github.com/MyPureCloud/purecloud-for-salesforce-examples/tree/post-message-example/src/Lightning%20Experience/events-in-salesforce) for a working example.
